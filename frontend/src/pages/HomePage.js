            Upon completing my computer science degree, I look forward to working as a software engineer, ideally, in the legal tech space. As a practicing attorney, I would be in a unique position to utilize both my computer science and legal skills to develop software and products that can be specifically tailored toward improving legal practice for attorneys and government entities.
